With the v2.7 release of the Grav Open Course Hub skeleton package MultiCourse Hubs are now supported.

![Multiple courses within a single Grav install](admin-panel-multiple-courses.png)  

Each course within a MultiCourse Hub is structured the same as a single course, and stored within its own top-level page (folder) with the template 'course'. A course header image, menubar, sidebar and footer can be specific to each course, or shared between one or more courses.

An automatically generated list of all courses within a site is possible by creating a top-level page with the template 'courselist', as shown below. Courses may also be selectively hidden from this list.
