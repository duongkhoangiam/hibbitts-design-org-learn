With the v2.7 release of the Grav Open Course Hub skeleton package MultiCourse Hubs are now supported.

Each course within a MultiCourse Hub is structured the same as a single course, including a course header image, menubar, sidebar and footer (as shown above). When a course is viewed, it appears to be identical to a single course. If preferred, a single course header image, sidebar, and footer can also be shared between one or more courses.
