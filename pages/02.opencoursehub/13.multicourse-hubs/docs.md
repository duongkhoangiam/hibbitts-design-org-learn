With the v2.7 release of the Grav Open Course Hub skeleton package MultiCourse Hubs are now supported.

![Multiple courses within a single Grav install](admin-panel-multiple-courses.png)  

Each course within a MultiCourse Hub is structured the same as a single course, including a course header image, menubar, sidebar and footer (as shown above). When a course is viewed, it appears to be identical to a single course. If preferred, a single course header image, sidebar, and footer can also be shared between one or more courses.

An automatically generated list of all courses within a site is possible by creating a top-level page with the template 'courselist', as shown below. Courses may also be selectively hidden from this list.
